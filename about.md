This is my blog, where I intend to collect in one place thoughts and code that I share with multiple people. Posts are works in progress, to be updated as I happen upon supporting or contradictory data points and my thoughts evolve. Changes are tracked [on GitHub](https://github.com/alecmocatta/alecmocatta.github.io).

For other places to find me, and my PGP key, see [keybase.io/mocatta](https://keybase.io/mocatta). You can email me at [alec@mocatta.net](mailto:alec@mocatta.net).
